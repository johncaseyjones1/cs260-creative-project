  <h1>We Should Go to Mars</h1>
  <hr>
  <h5>Casey Jones • 3 Dec 2016<br><br></h5>
  <p> On July 20, 1969, 500-million sat, glued to their televisions, as Neil Armstrong made American—and human—history. For the first time in the history of the known world, a human being stepped foot on an extraterrestrial surface. Leading up to this point, roughly 400,000 Americans worked to achieve this great and, at the time, unimaginable feat of scientific achievement (Fisk 176). This time, known now as the Space Race, provided a unifying environment that benefitted the country as no other event had before. For well over a decade, the country came together in a way that had never been so void of drawbacks; no death, no wars, only unity and scientific achievement (176). <br><br>
         	Space exploration has been a sign of national pride since these monumental periods, decades ago. So many technological advancements that have benefitted society, often unknown to the American public, have come from this period of progress. Sadly, since its height during the Space Race, focus and interest in space travel and discovery has waned. Now, however, the age of moon landings has ended, and science has set its sights on a much loftier objective; Mars colonization. In order to help bring the United States together in a time of disunity, as well as contributing many advancements that will benefit society in fields including medicine, transportation, and safety, NASA, as well other government space agencies, should pursue the goal of ultimately colonizing Mars. In order to really see where we are in respect to this goal, we need an understanding of the history of space exploration.<br><br>
  <h3>PAST HISTORY OF SPACE EXPLORATION</h3>
  <p> For the vast majority of human history, space was an unreachable frontier. Because of this, in 1957 the former Soviet Union, now Russia, shocked the world when they launched the first manmade satellite into Earth’s orbit. What was seen as a sign of pride and advancement in the eyes of Soviet citizens was seen in the eyes American’s as seemingly impending doom—with the technology to launch a satellite into earth’s orbit, perhaps the Soviet Union had the potential to missile strikes on American soil. In a rushed attempt to compete in this technology, America launched a rival satellite, Explorer 1, early the following year (Fisk 176). Thus, the space race had begun.<br><br>
  	What followed was a display of great engineering on the part of both countries, ultimately ending in the landing of Apollo 1 on the Moon, over a decade later in 1969. Since then, the speed of space exploration has slowly decelerated. In that time, we have seen many more feats of scientific space attainment; the space shuttle, advanced satellites, the International Space Station, to name but a few. We find ourselves today at just the dawn of a new era of space exploration, which leads ultimately to Mars colonization.<br><br>
  <h3>MODERN-DAY SPACE</h3>
  <p> Today, there are many different facets of extraterrestrial discovery that are being explored. Many corporations and governments are looking into the practicality of asteroid mining as a means of harvesting resources to be used on earth. Currently being developed are unmanned-robots that can build structures, over an extended period of time, on a distant planet, all on their own. There are even private businesses that are planning on selling trips to in Earth orbit for potential would-be astronauts.<br><br>
  	Perhaps receiving the most attention, however, are private corporations with plans to colonize Mars, some even by the year 2025 (Do 192). While a commendable goal, many of these companies are driven by motives that may result in mission headed with less than optimum safety (Slobodian 89).<br><br>
  <h3>WHY NASA?</h3>
  <p>What is it that drives business to do what it does? In the end, it comes down to profit; coming out of a deal with more money than they went into it with. Many may argue that space exploration and Mars colonization should be reserved for private industry and that government no longer should be involved in its progress. While it may be true that private industry has the money to achieve such a feat, currently, the way they are going about doing that, as well as the motivations behind doing that, are less than optimal. <br><br>Corporations that are aiming to colonize Mars are led more by egotisms, romanticism and a desire to make money than a pure and untainted desire for scientific exploration (Slobodian 89). One such company, Mars One, one of the flagships in this private enterprise space expansion, is intending on making a reality TV show of the Mars colonization, intending to sell the whole event to the world as an overly-romanticized space extravaganza on mainstream television, putting it with the likes of “Survivor” and “The Apprentice” (89).
  Additionally, many of these companies are making claims and promises of dates to land on Mars as well as the technology it would take to achieve such a feat that simply are not true. In a study and analysis of the technical feasibility of Mars One’s mission plan, Sydney Do has stated that<br><br>
  <h5>No Greed</h5>A government agency such as NASA, on the other hand, would not be reaching for such illustrious fame. While yes, it will surely be a well televised and public event, it will not be for entertainment like a reality TV show. The process of preparing to go to Mars and ultimately getting there will be one not motivated and running on popularity and fictitious concepts of what space travel is. It would be one run on safety and precaution, and it would be an event not rushed by an unrealistic deadline, potentially leading to even further safety concerns.<br><br>
  <h5>Unification of the Country</h5>In a recent Gallup poll from this past July, results showed an all-time low in American national pride. In this poll, only 52% percent of American’s claimed that they were “extremely proud” to be an American (Jones). Comparatively, in 2003, 70% of Americans claimed to be “extremely proud” (Jones). There is an obvious need for unification in the United States at this time. Sadly, with the way a large portion of America is reacting to this most recent election, there will be an even greater need in the near future.<br><br>
  	In the past, space exploration, specifically the Space Race and landing on the Moon, brought the United States together at a critical time in its history. Indeed, President John K. Kennedy saw the Apollo program as something that would change the nation in a way it had never been changed before and he was right (Fisk 177). Schools were known to encourage any students with an aptitude in math to be engineers, because “their country needed them” (177). President Kennedy also stated, “every scientist, every engineer, every technician, contractor and civil servant must give his personal pledge that this nation will move forward, with the full speed of freedom, in the exciting adventure of space’’ (176). Truly, another space race, this time to Mars, would absolutely have a similar effect on our country’s morale, with everyone working in unison to achieve a common goal.<br><br>
  <h5>Technological Advancements</h5>Nearly 2,000 inventions that extend into multiple different aspects of society have come from NASA’s research since 1976 (Lockney). These inventions range from LED lights used in the medical field, to microprocessors in our computers, to fireproof clothing for firefighters, to the portable cordless vacuum (Lockney). Many have argued that space travel and space exploration is not necessary, is not practical, is not useful in the real world. These objectors would likely think differently if they knew they could thank NASA for the chemical detectors in their homes, keeping them safe from fire and carbon-monoxide. Likely, indeed, they would have a different opinion if they knew that the artificial, prosthetic limb that improves the lives of so many in need has its roots in NASA robotics research. Anyone who enjoys knowing upcoming weather forecasts can thank NASA for the satellites orbiting the earth. In fact, everyone who eats food can thank NASA—they are responsible for recruiting Pillsbury to create the food safety system that the National Food and Drug Association uses to this day to keep our food safe (Lockney).<br><br>
  <h3>FINANCIAL CONCERNS</h3>
  Many have contended that the cost of funding NASA to go to Mars would be too large to handle. It is true; since 1966, the national funding for NASA programs has increased from $5,000,000 to roughly $20,000,000. These numbers may seem startling, but put into context, they are exactly the opposite of what objectors of NASA funding believe to be true. The proportion of the national budget that NASA takes up is at an unprecedented low since 1958, only three years since the programs origins (see figure 1 on page 6).<br><br>
  Additionally, NASA has programs, specifically the Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer(SBIR/STTR), that are made with the primary purpose of helping minority and underdeveloped technology businesses by partnering with them in the pursuit of scientific innovation (Talbert). In so doing, NASA had invested billions upon billions of dollars in individual states, increasing their economy substantially. Some notable state recipients include Colorado, Texas and California, receiving $1.7, $3 and $3.5 billion in investments respectively, solely in the year 2011 (Talbert).<br><br>
  	NASA research and technological development has also been known to increase the United States economy in dramatic ways. In a 1971 study to determine the effect of said activities conducted by NASA, the Midwest Research Institute determined that the economic impacts of NASA on the United States economy are “much more profound than superficial examinations would indicate” (MRI 46). Additionally, that same study deducted that the $25 billion spent in 1958 would return $181 billion by the end of 1987. Another study conducted by Chase Econometric Associates in 1976 deducted that an increase in the 1975 NASA budget by $1 billion would have increased jobs that year by 20,000 and created an additional 800,000 jobs by 1984 (Evans 10). Obviously these numbers would be different in the year 2016, but the principle behind it would still stand firm; across the board, increases in NASA funding result in more jobs, improved economic growth, and advances in technology that benefit our lives, increasing the overall quality of life of all Americans.<br><br>

  <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
   It takes a lot to bring an entire nation together in a common cause. Space exploration, the heart of NASA’s existence, has been seen to be capable of such a feat. Currently, we are in a state of disarray; tensions between opposing political factions are at high levels, additionally the amount of issues involving racism and religion are rising as well. We are in need of a unifying force, of a common cause that can bring the country together at a time of separation.
  	This unification would lead to an increase in our country’s economy as well, creating jobs and providing an increase in the overall GDP of our nation. Technology would advance, quality of life would increase, and we would see amazing leaps in the scientific discoveries of outer space. Like the Moon during the Space Race, the ultimate goal of Mars colonization would be the unifying objective for this cause. One day, decades in the future, we would become a multi-planetary species, expanding our knowledge and discovery into the firmament and beyond.
